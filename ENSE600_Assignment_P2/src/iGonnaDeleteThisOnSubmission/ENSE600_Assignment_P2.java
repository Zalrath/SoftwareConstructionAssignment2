-> Apply OOP concepts
    -> Abstraction
    -> Encapsulation
    -> Inheritance
    -> Polymorphism
-> Apply SOLID design principles
-> Use multiple classes with relationships

*/
// ---- Main Objectives ---- // 
/*

- Develop a GUI                         ->
- Implement a database                  -> Apache Derby DB, should be set up and preconfigured so the 
                                           markers dont need to do any manual configs, including manually launching the db
- Implement design patterns             ->
- Use git                               -> YAY WE DID IT
- Eliminate code smells                 -> very optimised
- Include unit tests                    -> Junit Framework
- Bug free                              -> :(

*/

// ----- Grade Distribution ----- // 
/*

-> GUI 20%
    -> Easy to use
    -> give user-friendly messages when a false input is given
    -> Well organised structure
    -> Users can quit at anytime without an error message
    -> Users can return to the main menu easily
-> Database 20%
    -> Derby Embedded mode is utilised
    -> The program can connect to the database without starting the database service
    -> 3 reading interactions using JDBC/Hibernate
    -> 3 writing interactions using JDBC/Hibernate
    -> JDBC/Hibernate is a key part of the programs functionality
-> Functionality 20%
    -> Easy to compile/run in NetBeans
    -> No manual configuration (no jar imports/DB setup needed)
    -> Complex enough features
    -> Perfect handling of invalid inputs

-> Design + Implementation 30%
    -> 12+ classes (for full marks), meaningful relationships
    -> Clear separation of UI & model (MVC recommended)
    -> OOP concepts (abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism)
    -> SOLID principles followed
    -> Appropriate design patterns applied
    -> No code smells
    -> Version control with multiple commits & merges
    -> ≥5 well-written JUnit test cases
    -> Robust error handling
